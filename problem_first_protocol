Help me explore this project through these key areas:

Problem Space & User Needs
Who experiences this problem most acutely?
What specific scenarios trigger this problem?
What existing solutions do people use?
Why aren't current solutions sufficient?

Solution Exploration
What different approaches could address these problems?
What formats would be most effective for the target users?
What are the key requirements for the solution to work?
How can we make the solution fit naturally into users' lives?

Core Features & MVP Scope
What is the minimum feature set needed to solve the core problem?
What would a successful solution look like?
How can we measure if it's working?
What could be added later to enhance the solution?

User Experience Vision
How should users discover and start using this solution?
What makes it compelling enough to use regularly?
How do we show progress and value?
What would make users recommend it to others?

Please help me think through these aspects before making technical decisions. Guide me through the decision-making process with clear reasoning and examples.
